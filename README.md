# Authentication

This project uses JWTAuthentication for authentication.

To authenticate a user and obtain a JWT token, send a POST request to the > `/auth/jwt/create/` endpoint with the user's credentials. 

The response will contain an access token and a refresh token. 

To access protected endpoints, include the access token in the request header with the prefix "JWT"(in Postman). 

For example: 

    Authorization: JWT eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ0b2tlbl90eXBlIjoicmVmcmVzaCIsImV4cCI6MTY4MTY1OTYxNiwianRpIjoiMGE1NWQ3NjY3NTQ5NDE2N2IxYjQ4YWExMmQ3MDYxZDUiLCJ1c2VyX2lkIjoyfQ.PLFx-W_Z0vycWtoqlZd1KaF7vs5qCW1qkdgat92s07Q


Note: In the request header, the prefix for JWT tokens is "JWT" instead of "Token".
You Need this to access the following endpoints.
